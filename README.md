\# Unreal Engine C++ Code Archive



This repository serves as a central collection of \*\*C++ source code\*\* extracted from my private Unreal Engine projects.  

It does \*\*not\*\* contain full projects, assets, or build files — only the code portions.  



---



\## Purpose:

\- Maintain a clean, versioned archive of gameplay systems, utilities, and patterns.  

\- Provide quick access to reusable snippets and components without project-specific clutter.  

\- Document the evolution of my Unreal Engine C++ workflow over time.  



---



\## Contents:

The repository may include:



\- \*\*Gameplay Components\*\*  

&nbsp; Custom interaction systems, inventory, ability logic, etc.  



\- \*\*Framework Code\*\*  

&nbsp; Actor base classes, controllers, subsystems, managers.  



\- \*\*Utility Functions \& Helpers\*\*  

&nbsp; Math utilities, serialization, data handling, convenience wrappers.  



\- \*\*Engine Extensions\*\*  

&nbsp; Custom `UObject` types, macros, and editor tools.  



> ⚠️ Since this repo is code-only, some snippets may reference assets, Blueprints, or systems that exist only in the original projects.  



---



\## Usage:

\- Browse files to explore implementation details.  

\- Copy snippets into your own Unreal Engine project if useful.  

\- Treat the repository as a \*\*reference library\*\*, not a standalone runnable project.  



---



\## Notes:

\- Code is \*\*periodically updated\*\* by syncing from multiple private repos.  

\- Structure may reflect \*\*experiments or in-progress ideas\*\*, not final production code.  

\- Unreal Engine version may vary depending on the source project.
